Capstone Project with login database and scraping

When the script is first ran you will arive at a page providing you with 3 options. The first option is to register an account into the database. User will be prompted to enter their username, email, and password. This will check and see if there is a user already registered with the same username and/or email as the person registering. If a same email or username is detected it will promt that the username or email is already in use. Once information is enterd and is good it will encrypt the users password and store all registration data in the programs database. The second option is to login. This will promt you to enter your username and password. It will compare the users


In the first part of the testing, the structure was built to display options for registration, login, and exiting the application. I chose the registration option to create a user, which was successful, and it took me back to the main menu. Next, I selected the login option to access my account. After logging in, I was presented with two choices: scraping or exiting the application. I chose the scraping option, which led me to a section for HTML scraping and web scraping. I first selected the HTML scraping option, and it successfully scraped all content from the HTML page. After that, I returned to the previous options and chose the web scraping option, which also successfully scraped all the data from there. I can confirm that the script is functioning as intended. We also checked if the application stored the entered data so that it didn't have to be re-entered, and I can confirm that it successfully stores information such as the username and password. Additionally, the application features password encryption. It's worth noting that users do not encounter errors when entering an invalid number for an option, as there is a while-loop in place to handle this scenario.
